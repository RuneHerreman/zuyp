# Zuyp — Plan hangouts, split the bill, get there safe

> A native Android app for planning casual hangouts with friends, keeping nights
> out transparent, and splitting shared expenses — with live maps, smart
> notifications, and sensor-driven shortcuts.

Zuyp is a solo-built Android app from my *Device Development* course (Applied
Computer Science, Howest). It started as a coursework brief and grew into a
fully-featured social planning app exploring the breadth of the Android
platform — local persistence, REST APIs, a message broker, GPS & maps,
geofencing, hardware sensors, the camera, foreground services and background
work.

## 💡 The idea

Modern life is increasingly mediated by technology, yet what we actually want
from a night out is human connection — and organising one is surprisingly
painful:

- **Communication fragmentation** — friends are spread across different apps and
  don't all check them regularly.
- **Planning chaos** — everyone has their own schedule and it's hard to line them up.
- **Lost connection** — a message that goes unanswered means a good evening slips by.

Zuyp tackles this with the philosophy of *"drinking with purpose"* — it's more
than an event app, it's a small platform for **social interaction, safety and
financial transparency**. It helps friends to:

- **Plan fast** — spin up a hangout in under a minute, or hit the SOS button.
- **Stay transparent** — shared expenses, settled fairly, no surprises.
- **Stay happy & safe** — a weather indicator suggests an outfit, and urgent
  alerts reach everyone instantly.

## ✨ Features

### Plan & attend hangouts
- Browse upcoming hangouts sorted by date, with location, time, attendee count
  and friend avatars on each card.
- Create hangouts with date/time pickers, an all-day switch and address search;
  the owner can edit or delete their own events.
- Hangout detail overlay with attendance status (going / not interested) and a
  "friends attending" filter.
- **Privacy model:** the home feed shows public hangouts plus the private ones
  you're actually part of.
- Invite friends in-app, or share an off-platform link (GitHub Pages →
  `zuyp://` deep link) that opens the event straight in the app.

### Split the bill
- Add shared expenses to a hangout with a paid-by selector, an attached receipt
  photo (camera or gallery) and reactive, cent-accurate balance calculation.
- **Equal split** or **custom split** with Tricount-style cascade auto-fill and
  validation, plus a settle-up flow.

### Discover (maps & location)
- Mapbox map showing your live location puck and markers for nearby hangouts.
- Tapping a marker animates and centres the camera, then slides up a popup that
  links through to the full hangout detail.
- Tap any location field (card, detail header, map popup) to open a maps
  chooser routed to the exact coordinates (`geo:` intent).

### Stay connected & safe
- Friendship graph (add/remove friends, view profiles) and groups
  (create / rename / leave, member avatar clusters).
- **Heads-up & full-screen notifications** over a RabbitMQ message broker, with
  separate channels for general hangout updates vs. urgent alerts.
- **SOS "Zuyp Alert":** a full-screen alarm activity that also pulses the
  device flashlight, with a one-tap action to join the event from the
  notification.

### Smart automation (sensors & background)
- **Shake to join** — the accelerometer auto-joins the hangout you're viewing.
- **Geofencing** — entering an event's area auto-marks you as `PRESENT` and a
  periodic hydration reminder pings every 30 minutes while you're there.
- **Foreground service** keeps the RabbitMQ connection alive after the app is
  killed so notifications still arrive.
- **Weather:** forecast at the event location with a "what to wear" dresscode
  tip, fetched from an external weather API.

## 🎨 Design & branding

The visual language pairs **nostalgic, tactile warmth** with the clean lines of
contemporary design, leaning on a grid with deliberate, intentional asymmetry.

**Typography**
- **Noto Serif** for headings and titles — the serif adds character and a
  premium feel that fits the app's purpose.
- **Inter** for everything else — modern and highly readable, giving the serif
  headings room to breathe.

**Palette**

| | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 🟦 | `#002366` | Primary |
| ⬜ | `#F5EFE0` | Secondary |
| ⬜ | `#FAF9F9` | Neutral |
| 🟦 | `#142A52` | Primary (faded) |
| 🟦 | `#435270` | Text |
| 🟦 | `#99BBFF` | Accent (40%) |
| ⬛ | `#4D4D4D` | Dark grey |
| ⬜ | `#E0E0E0` | Light grey |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** with an **MVVM** presentation layer,
organised into three layers under `be.runeherreman.zuyp`:

```
ui/        Jetpack Compose screens, ViewModels and UiState
            (home · discover · friends · profile · hangout · alert)
domain/    Business logic — models, repository interfaces, use cases
            (hangouts · expenses · friendship · groups · geofencing · …)
data/      Implementations — Room, DataStore, Mapbox, RabbitMQ, Retrofit,
            sensors, workers, foreground services, secure storage
di/        Hilt modules wiring everything together
```

- **Unidirectional data flow:** ViewModels expose immutable `UiState`; the data
  layer is reactive end-to-end via Kotlin `Flow`.
- **Use cases** isolate each piece of business logic from both the UI and the
  repositories.
- **Dependency injection** with Hilt across ViewModels, repositories, workers
  and services.

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit tests** for business logic: `AddExpenseUseCaseTest`,
  `UpdateAttendanceUseCaseTest`, `PublishMessageTest`.
- **Instrumented tests** for persistence and UI: `ExpenseDaoTest`,
  `UserDaoTest`, `HomeScreenTest`, `FriendsScreenTest`, `NavigationTest`,
  `HomeViewModelTest`.

```bash
./gradlew test                 # unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest # instrumented tests (device/emulator)
```

## 🚀 Getting started

**Requirements:** Android Studio (latest), JDK 11+, an Android 14+ (API 34)
device or emulator.

1. Clone the repo and open it in Android Studio.
2. Copy the example properties file and fill in your own keys:
   ```bash
   cp gradle.properties.example gradle.properties
   ```
   You'll need a **Mapbox** download token + access token, a **weather API**
   base URL, and **CloudAMQP (RabbitMQ)** credentials. Put the Mapbox access
   token in `app/src/main/res/values/mapbox_access_token.xml` (replace the
   `YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN` placeholder).
3. Run the app from Android Studio, or:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

> The project ships with seeded fake data, so the app is fully explorable
> without any backend running.

## 📐 Coursework context

Built solo for the *Device Development* module to demonstrate native Android
breadth — Compose UI, Room, Retrofit, a message broker, GPS/maps, geofencing,
two sensors, the camera, notification channels, WorkManager, encrypted storage
and an automated test suite. A detailed day-by-day development log is preserved
in the project's git history.
